We're really exited that you're about to contribute to the Rangasaurus open source project. If this is your first time contributing, please continue reading this contribtion guide on how to make the most meaningful and impactful contribution. 

Steps here outlined:

Create an Issue:

If you find a bug in the project, have trouble following the documentation or have a question about the project – create an issue! There’s nothing to it and whatever issue you’re having, you’ll quickly realise that you're not likely not the only one having it. This is for all of us to improve as a team and therefore whatever issue you're having will be for the betterment of all of us. 


Be clear about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem. Link to demos recreating the problem on things like JSFiddle or CodePen.Include system details like what the browser, library or operating system you’re using and its version.

Issues Pro Tips:

It is also important to check existing issues in case your issue was already raised. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running into has been addressed already.

If you’re able to patch the bug or add the feature yourself – fantastic, make a pull request with the code! Once you’ve submitted a pull request we'll compare your branch to the existing one and decide whether or not to incorporate your changes.

Pull Request Pro Tips:

Fork the repository and clone it locally. It is recommended that you connect your local to the original  repository by creating a branch or adding it as remote. Pull in changes from the repository often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. 

Be clear about what problem is and the the steps you took to make your changes.It’s best to test. Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed.

Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request. Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future. We encourage you to get creative in order to easily and effectively communicate the problem. 

Open Pull Requests:

Once you’ve opened a pull request a discussion will start around your proposed changes. You may be asked to make some changes to your pull request, if so, add more commits to your branch and push them – they’ll automatically go into the existing pull request. If all is well and your pull request as been incorportated celebrate!! You have once again contributed to an open source project.
