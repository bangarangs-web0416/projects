Pull Request Pro Tips:

Fork the repository and clone it locally. It is recommended that you connect your local to the original  repository by creating a branch or adding it as remote. Pull in changes from the repository often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. 

Be clear about what problem is and the the steps you took to make your changes.It’s best to test. Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed.

Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request. Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future. We encourage you to get creative in order to easily and effectively communicate the problem. 

Open Pull Requests:

Once you’ve opened a pull request a discussion will start around your proposed changes. You may be asked to make some changes to your pull request, if so, add more commits to your branch and push them – they’ll automatically go into the existing pull request. If all is well and your pull request as been incorportated celebrate!! You have once again contributed to an open source project.
